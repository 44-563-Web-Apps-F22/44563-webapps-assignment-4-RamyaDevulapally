  <p class="song">
    Sir Joseph's barge is seen,
    And its crowd of blushing beauties,
    We hope he'll find us clean,
    And attentive to our duties.
    We sail, we sail the ocean blue,
    And our saucy ship's a beauty.
    We're sober, sober men and true
    And attentive to our duty.
    We're smart and sober men,
    And quite devoid of fe-ar,
    In all the Royal N.
    None are so smart as we are.

  <h6 class="song_name">SONG—SIR JOSEPH</h6>

  <p class="song">When I was a lad I served a term
    As office boy to an Attorney's firm.
    I cleaned the windows and I swept the floor,
    And I polished up the handle of the big front door.
    I polished up that handle so carefullee
    That now I am the Ruler of the Queen's Navee!</p>

  <h6 class="chorus">CHORUS</h6>
  <p class="song">—He polished, etc
    As office boy I made such a mark
    That they gave me the post of a junior clerk.
    I served the writs with a smile so bland,
    And I copied all the letters in a big round hand—
    I copied all the letters in a hand so free,
    That now I am the Ruler of the Queen's Navee!</p>

  <h6 class="chorus">CHORUS</h6>
  <p class="song">- He copied, etc.
    In serving writs I made such a name
    That an articled clerk I soon became;
    I wore clean collars and a brand-new suit
    For the pass examination at the Institute,
    And that pass examination did so well for me,
    That now I am the Ruler of the Queen's Navee!</p>
