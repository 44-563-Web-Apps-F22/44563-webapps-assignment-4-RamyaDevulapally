        Sir Joseph's barge is seen,
                 And its crowd of blushing beauties,
            We hope he'll find us clean,
                 And attentive to our duties.
            We sail, we sail the ocean blue,
                 And our saucy ship's a beauty.
            We're sober, sober men and true
                 And attentive to our duty.
            We're smart and sober men,
                 And quite devoid of fe-ar,
            In all the Royal N.
                 None are so smart as we are.

  taunts;
